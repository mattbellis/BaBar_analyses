    "### `calculate_bits_for_PID_selector`\n",

    "* `trk_selector_map` which is the bit-packed representation of the selectors for each track for a given particle hypothesis (proton, pion, etc.)\n",
    "* `verbose` if you want more output set this to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns an integeer that represents the binary representation of the selectors as an `awkward` array. For example, `11001` or `1000001` but there are no leading zeros.\n",

    "* `selector` is the particular selector you want to see if the tracks passed (e.g. `TightKMProtonSelection`)\n",
